# aframe-test-desk

Recreate my This Place office desktop scene in Aframe

## Getting started

```
npm i ; grunt
```

## Learnings

- Models with faces that have more than 3 vertices will not load in THREE.js loaders (which is what AFrame is using)
- Ctrl + Alt + I opens the AFrame Inspector which you can use to rearrange entities in the scene. You can
copy the resultant HTML

## Blender Recap

- [Blender HotKeys](https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Reference/Hotkeys/Edit)
- After selection (A to select all), TAB enters Edit mode.
